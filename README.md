Brandroot – Flutter Mini Project

- Project Overview
Brandroot is my first mini project built using Flutter and Dart, marking the beginning of my mobile app development journey. It showcases the fundamentals of app development such as CRUD operations, authentication, and local storage, all wrapped in a custom-designed UI.
The app uses SharedPreferences and SecureStorage to handle user data locally without a backend, and includes features like login/register, home screen search, add details, and logout functionality. It also demonstrates basic state management and a user-friendly experience through thoughtful UI/UX design.
